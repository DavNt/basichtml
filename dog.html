		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			The domestic dog is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like 
			canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray 
			wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first 
			domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the 
			first species to be domesticated, and has been selectively bred over millennia for various 
			behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.
			<br><br>
			Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior 
			and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids. 
			Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. They perform many roles for humans, such as 
			hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, 
			more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles.
